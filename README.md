# Refragement

An incremental text based web game heavily inspired by [A Dark Room](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/), [Prestige Tree](https://jacorb90.me/Prestige-Tree/), and other incremental games.

A once lively world, reduced to a barren wasteland.  A decrepit research bunker, the last bastion of humanity.  A mysterious machine, capable of creating life from nothing.  A lone survivor, tasked with rebuilding the world.  A bad description, written by a programmer.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
