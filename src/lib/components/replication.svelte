  At first, the players is doing everything by hand (cranking the generator, making mining robots).
  Cranking the generator will be automated by upgrading the generator from hand crank, to coal fed, etc.
  This way the player has to tend to it less and less over time as the resource the generator uses becomes more energy dense.
    As a side note, this could become fleshed out to allow different types of generation, with things like heat based generation not needing resources but producing very little energy.
    Eventually, energy generation could even be completely phased out as a mechanic with, say, a dyson swarm.
  Other resources will be automated using replicators.  The idea is that mining robots are what mine for you, but they break down over time, which is why you have to make more.
  Replicators can automate this process by making mining, smelting, etc. robots for you every so often.
  The interesting way to do this would be to allow the player to manually mine for materials at the beginning until they can make a miner.
  The miner will mine a certain amount of materials every second for oh so many seconds.  Both can be upgraded.
  And finally, replicators can make miners.  Of course, the return on a miner will be good, at the base it can be 2.5x maybe?
  After that, for a while its just upgrades to the efficiency of the various robots.
  
  While I'm writing ideas down, I"m thinking that the prestige mechanic could be in the form of travelling to different timelines.
  The idea is that you travel to a timeline with better conditions and start over there with new knowledge.
    In terms of story though, I'm not a big fan of this.  I like the idea of this being the last chance a lot better.
    Maybe I could have it be mentioned that its an unstable branching of the time stream, and eventually localized time anomalies (the research bunker) will be merged into the main timeline, but materials don't survive the trip.
    Although, I guess the story of this game isn't all that important.  But still, I would like it to be internally consistent.
